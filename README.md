Local Facts role
=========

````dmccuk.local_facts```` is an [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) role that gives you a framework to implement local facts within your server environment with minimal setup. You can create facts relevant to your organisation by updating the ````files/customFactSetup.sh```` script with your own defaults.

I have included both AWS and AZURE fact generation to give you an example of how to set this up. Make your own adjustments as required.

 * This role installs NO packages.
 * Creates a local ````/etc/ansible/facts.d/local.fact```` file in the default ansible location.
 * Runs a script to collect facts and add them to the ````local.fact```` file.
 * Example: Creates a local ````/tmp/local_facts```` file containg some of the custom facts.
 * Example AWS fact creation can be found in ````files/customFactSetup.sh````

Edit as required.

Installation
===========

Using ansible-galaxy:
````
$ ansible-galaxy install dmccuk.local_facts
````

Using ansible-galaxy to install to the current directory:
````
$ ansible-galaxy install --roles-path . dmccuk.local_facts
````

Using requirements.yml:
```
- src: dmccuk.local_facts
````

Using git:
````
$ git clone https://github.com/dmccuk/local-facts.git
````

Requirements
------------

There are no specific requirements to use this role. Just an ansible version of 2.5 or above.

In the code I give examples of creating local facts from AWS meta-data. You can use this or remove it and add your own.

Role Variables
--------------

There are no specific role variables. Instead you can configure you're own variables to pull out custom facts and use them in your playbooks.

Dependencies
------------

Ansible >= 2.5

Example Playbook
----------------

An example of how to use the role:

````
- hosts: all
  gather_facts: True
  roles:
    - local_facts
````

Creating Custom facts
------------

Custom facts are created by running a script that works out the facts and populates the /etc/ansible/fact.d/local.fact file. In this role, you can find the script under ````..file/customFactSetup.sh````. I have given you some simple examples of creating facts based on AWS meta-data as well as an example case statements to provide logic for how the fact will be populated.

The ````default/main.yml```` file converts the ansible_local_facts into varibles we can use in our playbooks. For example:

````
---
# defaults file for local_facts
server_env: "{{ ansible_local.local.local_facts.support_team }}"
support_team: "{{ ansible_local.local.local_facts.support_team }}"
ec2_region: "{{ ansible_local.local.local_facts.ec2_region }}"
````

You can update these examples to fit your needs.

Example clone and run
---------------------
In this example, I clone the role and run it against the localhost. To run against your inventory, just change the ````- hosts: <server>```` to what you need it to be.

````
$ ansible-galaxy install --roles-path . dmccuk.local_facts
- downloading role 'local_facts', owned by dmccuk
- downloading role from https://github.com/dmccuk/local-facts/archive/master.tar.gz
- extracting dmccuk.local_facts to /home/ubuntu/dmccuk.local_facts
- dmccuk.local_facts (master) was installed successfully

$ vi deploy.yaml
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: True

$ ansible-playbook deploy.yaml
[WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note that the implicit localhost does not match
'all'

[local_facts]

$ cat /tmp/local_facts
These are the ansible variables from the playbook:
you can use them in a template like this:

environment is web
The server support team is the web team.
Your EC2 regions is eu-central-1.

## View the local facts using JQ
To view the local facts file you just created, make sure JQ is installed and run the following:

```
$ ansible localhost -m setup | sed '1 s/^.*$/{/' | jq '.ansible_facts.ansible_local.local'
{
  "local_facts": {
    "ami_id": "ami-093762347983f511b",
    "avail_zone": "eu-west-2b",
    "callout": "8-6",
    "cloud": "AWS",
    "environment": "Dev",
    "instance_type": "t2.micro",
    "region": "eu-west-2",
    "support_team": "web"
  }
}
```

Or to greab a specific fact, you can run the following:
```
$ ansible localhost -m setup | sed '1 s/^.*$/{/' | jq '.ansible_facts.ansible_local.local.local_facts.instance_type'
"t2.micro"
```

Now make the changes you need for your environment re-run.
